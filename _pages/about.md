<span id="handwave">üëãüèª</span> Hi! I'm an undergraduate student and researcher at the [University of Washington (UW)](https://washington.edu/). I double major in computer science (with honors) and statistics, with a minor in mathematics. I am also a research collaborator working with the [Perceptual Reasoning and Interaction Research (PRIOR)](https://prior.allenai.org/) team at the [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (Ai2)](https://allenai.org/).

At UW, I am fortunate to be co-advised by Prof [Ranjay Krishna](https://www.ranjaykrishna.com/) at the [Reasoning, AI, and VisioN (RAIVN) Lab](https://raivn.cs.washington.edu/) and Prof [Dieter Fox](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~fox/) at the [Robotics and State Estimation (RSE) Lab](https://rse-lab.cs.washington.edu/) in UW [CSE](https://cs.washington.edu/). Before that, I was advised by Prof [Jenq-Neng Hwang](https://people.ece.uw.edu/hwang/) at the [Information Processing Lab (IPL)](https://ipl-uw.github.io/) in UW [ECE](https://www.ece.uw.edu/). I am also pleased to be mentored by Dr [Jiafei Duan](https://duanjiafei.com/) and Dr [Ying Jin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MNrLDhwAAAAJ&hl=en/). At Ai2 PRIOR, I am fortunate to be mentored by Prof [Ranjay Krishna](https://www.ranjaykrishna.com/) and Dr [Jiafei Duan](https://duanjiafei.com/), and sponsored by Dr [Rose Hendrix](https://rosehendrix.com/).

My research interests are broadly in the fields of computer vision, machine learning, and embodied AI. I am especially passionate about robot learning, imitation learning, behavior cloning, and foundation models for robotics.
